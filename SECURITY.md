- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### What to Expect

3. Credit you in our security advisories (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

- Keep your dependencies up to date
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Enable two-factor authentication where possible
- Regularly review access permissions
- Report suspicious activity immediately

### For Developers

- Follow secure coding practices
- Validate all input data
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Keep dependencies updated
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Implement proper error handling
- Regular security audits

## Security Features

### Authentication
- JWT token-based authentication
- Secure password hashing with bcrypt
- Session management with automatic timeout
- Multi-factor authentication support

### Data Protection
- HTTPS encryption for all communications
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection
- CSRF protection

### API Security
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- CORS configuration
- Request validation
- Error handling without information disclosure

## Known Security Considerations

### Environment Variables
- Never commit `.env` files to version control
- Use strong, unique values for all secrets
- Rotate keys regularly
- Use different keys for different environments

### Database Security
- Use connection pooling
- Implement proper access controls
- Regular security updates
- Monitor for suspicious activity

### File Uploads
- Validate file types and sizes
- Scan uploaded files for malware
- Store files outside web root
- Use secure file names
